# google-stock-price-prediction
In this project, I aim to create a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that can predict future opening stock prices of Google based on past opening stock prices. The dataset's training set contains Google's stock prices on every open stock market day from 2012 to 2016 while the test set contains Google's stock prices on every open stock market day of January 2017. The project was developed with Keras, Pandas, and Numpy.

Topics covered in this project are:
- Deep Learning
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks
- Time Series Forecasting
